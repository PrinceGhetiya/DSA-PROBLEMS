# Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

Welcome to my personal repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **Java**. This repository serves as a collection of my daily coding exercises, solutions, and projects to solidify my understanding of DSA concepts.

## 📚 About this Repository

In this repository, you'll find:

- **Java implementations** of various data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- **Algorithms** covering searching, sorting, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and graph algorithms.
- Regular practice sessions to improve coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Daily Commit Practices**: Every day, I solve a new problem or learn a new concept and commit my progress to this repository.
- **Clear Code with Comments**: Each implementation includes detailed comments explaining the code logic.
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: I try to implement multiple approaches to solve the same problem, showcasing different algorithms.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries**: Any external libraries or tools used (e.g., JUnit for testing) will be mentioned here.

## 💻 How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Savaliya/DSA-with-JAVA.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
 ```bash
   cd DSA-with-JAVA
   ```
3. Browse through the folder structure, where each sub-folder corresponds to a different data structure/algorithm.
4. Open the Java files in any IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code) to run the code.
